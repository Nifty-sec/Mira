# Mira
Developmental Windows Exploitation Framework

Mira is intended to be a tool for identifying, recommending, and executing the exploitation of vulnerable windows processes. 
Mira is being built to serve as a method of learning for myself, and others interested in the project. Mira is not intended for malicious use. Mira is intended as an educational opportunity to explore various methods of process injection all within one package.
